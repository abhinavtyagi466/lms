# KPI Trigger Dashboard Fixes

## Issues Identified:

1. ✅ **Preview button not activating** - FIXED
   - Was checking `!period` but period is auto-detected from Excel
   - Changed to only require `!selectedFile`

2. ✅ **Upload button not activating** - FIXED  
   - Same issue, now shows helper text about previewing first
   - Will be enabled after preview detects period

3. ❌ **Email not reaching user dashboard** - NEEDS VERIFICATION
   - Backend sends emails via EmailTemplateService
   - Creates notifications with user ID
   - Frontend NotificationBell polls for notifications
   - Need to test end-to-end flow

4. ❌ **No email preview in KPI dashboard** - NEEDS IMPLEMENTATION
   - Currently only shows trigger preview (trainings, audits)
   - User wants to see what email will look like
   - Need to add email preview modal

## Fixes Applied:

### 1. Button Activation (KPITriggerDashboard.tsx)

**Preview Button:**
```tsx
// BEFORE:
disabled={!selectedFile || !period || previewLoading}

// AFTER:
disabled={!selectedFile || previewLoading}
```

**Upload Button:**
```tsx
// BEFORE:
disabled={!selectedFile || !period || uploading}

// AFTER:
disabled={!selectedFile || !period || uploading}
// Still requires period but now shows helpful message
```

### 2. Helper Messages Added

- Blue message when file selected: "Click Preview Triggers"
- Green message when period detected: Shows period value
- User guidance for workflow

### 3. Better Upload Button Styling

```tsx
className="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-600 to-indigo-700 hover:from-blue-700 hover:to-indigo-800 text-white shadow-lg disabled:opacity-50 disabled:cursor-not-allowed"
```

## Still To Do:

### A. Add Email Preview Feature

When user clicks "Preview Triggers", also show:
1. Matched user details (Employee ID, Email, Name)
2. What emails will be sent
3. Email preview button for each user
4. Modal to show rendered email with all variables filled

### B. Verify Notification Flow

1. Upload KPI Excel
2. Process triggers
3. Check if notification appears in user's bell
4. Check if notification contains correct data
5. Check if email log is created

### C. Email Preview Modal Design

Should show:
- Email subject (rendered)
- Email body (HTML rendered)
- Recipient list
- Metadata (KPI score, rating, period)
- Preview should be centered and large

## Testing Steps:

1. Download template
2. Fill with actual user email + employee ID
3. Upload file
4. Click "Preview Triggers"
   - Should show matched user with correct details
   - Should show what actions will be taken
   - Should enable "Upload & Process" button
5. Click "Upload & Process"
   - Should create KPI record
   - Should send emails (console logged)
   - Should create notifications
6. Login as that user
7. Check notification bell
   - Should show unread count
   - Should show KPI notification
   - Should have correct metadata

## Expected Flow:

```
Admin: Upload Excel (with Email + Employee ID)
  ↓
System: Match user by Email → Employee ID → Name
  ↓
Admin: Click "Preview Triggers"
  ↓
System: Show matched user + triggers + email preview
  ↓
Admin: Click "Upload & Process"
  ↓
System: 
  - Create KPI record
  - Send emails via EmailTemplateService
  - Create EmailLog
  - Create Notification with userId
  - Create TrainingAssignment
  - Create AuditSchedule
  ↓
User: Login
  ↓
NotificationBell: Fetch notifications
  ↓
User: See notification with KPI data
```

## Data Flow Verification:

### Backend (kpiTriggerService.js):
```javascript
executeTrigger() {
  // 1. Create training/audit
  // 2. Send email via EmailTemplateService
  // 3. EmailTemplateService creates:
  //    - EmailLog (with userId)
  //    - Notification (with userId + metadata)
  // 4. User should see in dashboard
}
```

### Frontend (NotificationBell.tsx):
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  fetchNotifications(); // Calls /api/notifications
  setInterval(fetchNotifications, 30000); // Every 30s
}, [user]);
```

### API (notifications.js):
```javascript
GET /api/notifications
  → Notification.getUserNotifications(req.user._id)
  → Returns all user's notifications
```

## Next Steps:

1. ✅ Fix button activation - DONE
2. ✅ Add helper messages - DONE
3. ⏳ Test notification flow
4. ⏳ Add email preview to KPI dashboard (optional enhancement)
5. ⏳ Verify user receives notification with correct data
