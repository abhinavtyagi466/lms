# ✅ KPI TRIGGER - COMPLETE FIX + EMAIL LOGIC

## 🔴 ISSUES FIXED:

### **Issue 1: Multer "Unexpected end of form" ✅**
**Problem:** express-fileupload conflicting with multer  
**Fix:** Made express-fileupload skip `/api/kpi-triggers` routes

### **Issue 2: KPIScore Validation Error ✅**
**Problem:** Missing required fields (`submittedBy`, all `.percentage` fields)  
**Fix:** Updated `saveKPIScore()` to include all required fields:
```javascript
{
  tat: { percentage: ... },
  majorNegativity: { percentage: ... },
  quality: { percentage: ... },
  neighborCheck: { percentage: ... },
  negativity: { percentage: ... },
  appUsage: { percentage: ... },
  insufficiency: { percentage: ... },
  submittedBy: adminUserId // NOW INCLUDED
}
```

### **Issue 3: User Matching Not Using Employee ID/Email ✅**
**Problem:** Was only matching by name  
**Fix:** Enhanced `findOrCreateUser()` with priority matching:
1. Employee ID (highest priority)
2. Email
3. Name (regex, lowest priority)

## 🔍 HOW IT WORKS:

### **Step 1: Excel Upload**
Admin uploads Excel with:
- Month
- FE Name
- Employee ID
- Email
- All KPI metrics (TAT %, Major Negative %, etc.)

### **Step 2: User Matching**
System matches FE to existing users:
1. By Employee ID (exact match)
2. By Email (exact match)
3. By Name (case-insensitive regex)
4. If no match → creates new user

### **Step 3: KPI Calculation**
System calculates:
- Individual scores (TAT, Major Negativity, Quality, etc.)
- Overall KPI score (0-100)
- Rating (Outstanding/Excellent/Satisfactory/Need Improvement/Unsatisfactory)

### **Step 4: Trigger Evaluation**
System checks:
- **Score-based triggers** (based on overall KPI score range)
- **Condition-based triggers** (based on specific metric thresholds)

### **Step 5: Email Dispatch**
For each trigger:
- Selects appropriate email template
- Populates variables (userName, kpiScore, rating, etc.)
- Determines recipients based on trigger type
- Sends emails to all recipients
- Logs in `EmailLog` collection
- Creates in-app notification for FE

### **Step 6: Database Records**
System creates:
- `KPIScore` record (with all metrics)
- `TrainingAssignment` record (if training triggered)
- `AuditSchedule` record (if audit triggered)
- `Notification` record (in-app notification)
- `EmailLog` records (for each email sent)

---

## ✅ VALIDATION RULES:

### **Excel Validation:**
- ✅ Must have "Month" column (auto-detects period)
- ✅ Must have "FE" column (user name)
- ✅ Must have "Employee ID" column (for matching)
- ✅ Must have "Email" column (for matching)
- ✅ Must have all KPI metric columns (TAT %, Major Negative %, etc.)

### **KPI Calculation Validation:**
- ✅ All percentages default to 0 if missing
- ✅ Scores calculated per exact KPI criteria
- ✅ Overall score = sum of all individual scores
- ✅ Rating based on overall score range

### **Email Logic Validation:**
- ✅ 85-100% → No warning, eligible for reward
- ✅ 70-84% → Only audit, no training, no warning
- ✅ 50-69% → Only audit, no training, no warning
- ✅ 40-49% → Training + Audit, no warning
- ✅ Below 40% → Training + Audit + **Warning Letter**
- ✅ Condition triggers are ADDITIVE (can trigger multiple emails)
