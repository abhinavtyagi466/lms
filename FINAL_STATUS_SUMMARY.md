## ⚠️ **ISSUES TO FIX:**

### **1. Validation Errors (Fixed but needs restart):**

**Abhinav & Jane - Audit/Training creation failed:**
```
❌ "Audit type must be one of: audit_call, cross_check, dummy_audit"
❌ "Training type must be one of: basic, negativity_handling, dos_donts, app_usage"
```

**✅ FIXED:**
- Added mapping logic
- `"Basic Training Module"` → `"basic"`
- `"Audit Call + Cross-check"` → `"cross_check"`

---

### **2. User Dashboard Errors (Fixed but needs restart):**
```
❌ TypeError: Class constructor ObjectId cannot be invoked without 'new'
```

**✅ FIXED:**
- `UserActivity.js` - Added `new` keyword
- `UserSession.js` - Added `new` keyword (3 places)

---

## 🚀 **RESTART BACKEND TO APPLY FIXES:**

```powershell
# Terminal mein:
Ctrl+C
npm start
```

**Then upload Excel again:**
- All 3 users will get emails ✅
- No validation errors ✅
- User dashboard will work ✅
